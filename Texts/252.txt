Disillusion is the greatest gift I can give you. But, because of your fondness for illusion, you consider the term negative. You commiserate with a friend by saying, "Oh, what a disillusioning experience that must have been," when you ought to be celebrating with him. The word dis-illusion is literally a "freeing from illusion." But you cling to your illusions.
