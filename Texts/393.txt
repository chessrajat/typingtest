It wasn't something that I thought about, but I knew that you were absolute in doubt. I just really wanna talk to you again, that's how I know that I'ma haunt you in the end. It wasn't something 'til you brought it up, I knew that you were tryna make it out. Without a single scar, clawing at my arm, I saw you in his car, swear I knew it from the start.
