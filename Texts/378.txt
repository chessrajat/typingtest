My name is Dr. Glenn Pierce, and by now you may have realized that all of this has happened exactly the way it was supposed to. You see, everyone who comes to the institute does so because they feel that they are no longer in control of something important to them. But, more often than not, the problem is not that the problems we face can't be solved: the problem is that we become so afraid of failure that we refuse to see our problems from a new perspective. And so we do the same things again and again and again.
