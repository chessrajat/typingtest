Isn't that something? That is pretty. I like these kind of paintings. And you know me, shoot, there's a minute or two left here, let's have us a happy tree. We'll just take the knife, maybe we'll have an old birch tree that lives right here. Let's just let it run all the way up here. Now, you could have left the birch tree inside of the oval, but I sort of like it when it sneaks out a little bit. But when you do your painting, you make that decision. If you want him to live inside that oval, you put that rascal in there and keep him in there.
