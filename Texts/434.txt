The night beckons while you dream, a life never lives in peace. As you stand upon the edge, woven by a single thread. And fate may fall down upon you, while the devil is knocking, right at your door. So all you restless, each night you hear the drums of war. Awaken, awaken. The voice begins to call you while you hunger, a taste of destiny you're searching for.
