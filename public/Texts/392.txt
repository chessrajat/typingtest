You're telling us you killed those three young men on the subway? And why should we believe you? I've got nothing left to lose, nothing can hurt me anymore. My life, is nothing but a comedy. Let me get this straight, you think killing those guys is funny. I do, and I'm tired of pretending it's not. Comedy is subjective Murray, isn't that what they say. All of you, this system that knows so much, you decide what's right or wrong. The same way that you decide what's funny, or not.
