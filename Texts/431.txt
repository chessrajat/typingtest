First week of boot camp, they taught us a lesson. A good soldier knows there's only one thing he can rely on when the chips are down: Not his cutting edge intel, not his state of the art equipment, and not his top of the line weapon. Just himself: It took me a long time to remember that. For now, the war is over. I made mistakes along the way. But after all, I'm only human. My name is Laurence Barnes. They called me Prophet. Remember me.
